1. What is an object?
- a collection of name value pairs
- have data inside of it (value?)
- variables inside variables-organizes variables
eg var circle= {
    x: 0,
    y: 0,
    diameter: 50
  };

2. How do you access a property of an object?
- refers back to the var object with a dot syntax
eg ellipse(circle.x);


Array:
- an array is a list of values in seperated commas, and embedded in a open and close square bracket
- it starts to count from 0 instead of 1


3. What is the index of the first item in an array?
- index is 0
- Always need to start counting the elements from 0 


4. What syntax can you use to get the third item in an array?
- refer to the array name and index which would be nums[2]
- nums would refer to the whole array
- i.e. text(words[index], 12, 200); ... index = index + 1;

5. How do you use a variable and a loop to get every item in an array?
- use a for loop that uses the var i in the function
- can use an array to have a lot of elements and apply the same action to all elements in that array
eg for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    ellipse(i * 100 + 100, 200, nums[i], nums[i]);
  }
